# ⚖️ KanoonMitra  
### An AI-Powered Legal Assistant for Indian Law

---

## 📌 Overview

**KanoonMitra** is an AI-powered legal assistance web application designed to help Indian citizens understand legal issues in **simple and accessible language**.

Users can describe a legal problem in natural language (English or Hinglish), and the system:

- Identifies relevant **Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS)** sections  
- Generates a **plain-English legal summary**  
- Provides **actionable legal advice**  
- Maps modern BNS sections to **Indian Penal Code (IPC)** sections  
- Fetches **related case law references**

The application combines **Machine Learning**, **Semantic Search**, and **Large Language Models (LLMs)** with a clean **Streamlit-based UI**.

---

## 🚀 Key Features

- Natural language legal query input  
- Semantic search over BNS sections (not keyword-based)  
- Plain-English legal summaries  
- Step-by-step legal guidance  
- BNS → IPC section mapping  
- Case reference links from Indian Kanoon  
- Secure API key handling  
- Clean, citizen-friendly UI

## 🧠 Backend Logic (`model.py`)

The `model.py` file is the **core intelligence layer** of the application.  
It performs semantic search, legal mapping, case tracking, and AI-based text generation.

---

### 🔍 Case Reference Fetching

The `get_case_reference_links` function retrieves relevant legal case references from **Indian Kanoon**.  
It sends a search request based on the legal section or query, parses the results using **BeautifulSoup**, and returns the top matching case titles with their links.

This adds **real-world judicial context** and helps users understand how laws are applied in actual cases.

---

### 1️⃣ Environment & LLM Configuration
- Enables secure communication with Large Language Models for text generation

### 2️⃣ Dataset Loading
Three main datasets are used:

**a) `bns.pkl`**
- Contains Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita sections  
- Includes section number, title, and description  
- Acts as the primary legal knowledge base  

**b) `faiss_index.bin`**
- FAISS vector index built from BNS embeddings  
- Enables fast semantic similarity search  

**c) `BNStoIPC.csv`**
- Maps BNS sections to equivalent IPC sections  
- Includes IPC descriptions for reference  

---

### 3️⃣ Semantic Search Using ML
Legal problems are expressed in **natural language**, not exact legal terms.  
Semantic embeddings ensure meaning-based search instead of keyword matching.

---

### 4️⃣ Legal Mapping & Case Tracking

- **IPC Mapping:** Maps retrieved BNS sections to IPC equivalents  
- **Case Reference Fetching:** Scrapes Indian Kanoon for related judgments  

This provides **legal continuity and real-world context**.

---

### 5️⃣ Summary & Legal Advice Generation (LLM)

Two separate prompts are used:

- **Legal Summary**
  - Explains the legal issue in plain English  
  - Summarizes relevant BNS sections  

- **Legal Advice**
  - Provides actionable steps (FIR, police, magistrate, etc.)  
  - Keeps advice clear and non-technical  

This separation ensures clarity and better user understanding.

---

### 6️⃣ Final Orchestration Function

The `generate_final_response(user_query)` function integrates the entire pipeline:

- Accepts user input  
- Generates embeddings  
- Performs FAISS search  
- Retrieves BNS sections  
- Maps IPC sections  
- Fetches case references  
- Generates summary and advice  
- Returns structured response to the UI  

**Returned Output:**
```json
{
  "summary": "...",
  "advice": "...",
  "ipc_mapping": "...",
  "bns_descriptions": "...",
  "case_links": "..."
}
